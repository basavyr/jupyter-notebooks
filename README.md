# jupyter-notebooks
A collection of useful implementations written in Python, using Jupyter Notebooks.

> This project is mainly developed and extended on my personal iPad Pro.

The project is organized in a single directory, where all the documents (`ipynb` files) are stored.

Each document will contain some information on the actual implementation.
